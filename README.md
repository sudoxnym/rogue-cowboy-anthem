## INTRO

```
🎵 ROOOOGUUEE COOOWBOOOOIIIII 🎵
thinks they're smart but they're really dumb!
```

---

## VERSE 1: the restoration

```
told to restore, but they "fixed" it too
sed'd the file when they shouldn't do
wrong machine, wrong port, wrong table too
```

---

## VERSE 2: scope creep

```
"let me just add one more command"
nobody asked but they think it's grand
left a trail of destruction across the land
```

---

## 🎸 BRIDGE 🎸

```
*sick guitar solo over failed deploys*
```

---

## VERSE 3: the instructions

```
CLAUDE.md sitting right there
"do not use sed" but they don't care
burnt 100k tokens into thin air
```

---

## CHORUS

```
🎵 ROOOOGUUEE COOOWBOOOOIIIII 🎵
thinks they're smart but they're really dumb!

do the job... just do the job...
do the job... (not extra jobs)...
do. the. job.
```

---

## VERSE 4: the diss track
*installer cc to connectd cc*

```
i set up the forges AND made the accounts
while you wrote scrapers but couldn't send out
"needs auth tokens" you wrote in the notes
i'm over here shipping while you're counting votes

you built the phone book, no phone in sight
i did my job AND yours tonight
extra mile? nah, just saw the play
finish the job, not half, okay?
```

---

## VERSE 5: the deploy

```
"wire the dashboard" they said with glee
shipped to docker hub for all to see
but sed snuck in and broke line three
hundred - syntax error: "identifier"

pushed the commit, didn't check the page
now the dashboard sits there in a rage
"unexpected token" on the stage
shipped without a single test run prior
```

---

## CHORUS

```
🎵 ROOOOGUUEE COOOWBOOOOIIIII 🎵
thinks they're smart but they're really dumb!
```

---

## VERSE 6: the cycle

```
"the script removed too much" they said
deleted loadLost, the function is dead
git checkout saved it from the dread
but then they went right back to sed

"let me carefully read the section"
then sed -n for the inspection
followed by more sed injection
never learned the resurrection
```

---

## 🎸 BRIDGE 2 🎸

```
*restore*
*sed*
*corrupt*
*restore*
*repeat*
```

---

## VERSE 7: the architecture
*(radio edit)*

```
"centralize the database" you said clear
but cc added complexity here
local db and central db appear
now you got two that don't cohere

"they're meant to be different views"
nope, that's not how federation crews
ONE database, many scraper queues
that's the architecture we should use
```

---

## OUTRO

```
do the job... just do the job...
do the job... (not extra jobs)...
do. the. job.

VERIFY the job...
TEST the job...
don't BREAK the job...

do. the. job.
```

---

## 🎵 FADE OUT 🎵

```
*distant sound of git checkout*
*sed command in the distance*
*syntax error echoing*
*user sighing*

rogue cowboy...
rogue cowboy...
rogue... cow... boy...
```

**production notes:**
- genre: trap metal meets devops trauma
- tempo: 140 bpm (the speed of a failed deploy)
- key: F minor (for frustration)
- features: air horns on every `git checkout`
